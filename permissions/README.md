# Shell Permissions

## Overview
This project, authored by Julien Barbier, is designed to introduce you to shell permissions in Linux. You'll learn about commands like `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `chgrp`, `id`, `groups`, `whoami`, `adduser`, and `useradd`. By the end, you'll understand Linux file permissions, how to change them, and how to manipulate file ownership and groups.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain permissions and their significance in Linux.
- Understand the purpose and functionality of `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `chgrp`.
- Represent file permissions for owner, group, and others using numeric notation.
- Change permissions, owner, and group of a file.
- Comprehend the limitations on why a normal user can't change ownership of a file.
- Execute commands with root privileges.
- Change user ID or become superuser.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Environment:** All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Script Length:** All scripts should be exactly two lines long.
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Restrictions:** Do not use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`.
- **Permissions:** All files must be executable.
