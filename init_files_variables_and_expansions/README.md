# Shell, Init Files, Variables, and Expansions - Amateur

## Overview
This project, authored by Julien Barbier, delves into shell initialization files, variables, expansions, and aliases in Linux shell scripting. You'll learn about setting up environment variables, creating aliases, understanding different types of variables, and performing arithmetic operations within the shell.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the behavior of `$ ls -l *.txt`.
- Recognize and comprehend shell initialization files like `/etc/profile`, `/etc/profile.d`, and `~/.bashrc`.
- Differentiate between local and global variables and understand reserved variables.
- Create, update, and delete shell variables.
- Know the roles of reserved variables like `HOME`, `PATH`, and `PS1`, along with special parameters like `$?`.
- Utilize expansions, understand the differences between single and double quotes, and perform command       
  substitution.
- Perform shell arithmetic operations and create aliases.
- Execute commands from a file in the current shell.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Environment:** All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Script Length:** All scripts should be exactly two lines long.
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Restrictions:** Do not use `&&`, `||`, `bc`, `sed`, or `awk`.
- **Permissions:** All files must be executable.
