# Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters

## Overview
This project, authored by Julien Barbier, introduces concepts related to shell, I/O redirections, and filters in Linux. You'll learn about various commands such as `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr`, `rev`, `cut`, `echo`, `cat`, and more. By the end of this project, you'll understand how to manipulate input and output streams, combine commands, and utilize special characters effectively.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain shell I/O redirection and its significance.
- Understand the functionality of commands like `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr`, `rev`, `cut`, etc.
- Redirect standard output to a file and get standard input from a file.
- Send output from one program to the input of another program.
- Combine commands and filters with redirections.
- Comprehend special characters and know when and how to use them.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Environment:** All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Script Length:** All scripts should be exactly two lines long.
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Restrictions:** Do not use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`.
- **Permissions:** All files must be executable.
- **Additional Notes:** You are not allowed to use sed or awk.
